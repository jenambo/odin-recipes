        <!-- Steps for the recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer.</li>
            <li>Evenly combine the dry ingredients using a whisk or fork.</li>
            <li>Add the milk, water, and salt to the bowl. With the mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment, combine the dough on medium-low speed until almost homogeneous.</li>
            <li>Begin adding the butter, one cube at a time, and waiting until each cube is incorporated before adding another one until all of the butter has been added.</li>
            <li>Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough is smooth, elastic, and clears the sides of the bowl, about 6-8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough to a large greased bowl and cover it with plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>Let the dough proof until about doubled in size, about 1-2 hours depending on the warmth of the room.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, grease 1 large tube or bundt pan or loaf pan or muffin tin generously with non-stick spray.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the ham and cheese. Toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a lightly oiled work surface. Divide and shape the dough into even golf-ball-sized portions. *If using a muffin tin, make portions half the size.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough balls in the melted butter and then in the ham and cheese mixture. Place them into the prepared baking pan(s).</li>
            <li>Loosely cover the pan(s), and allow the dough to proof for another 45 minutes - 1 hour, until puffed.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350 °F.</li>
            <li>Once risen, remove the plastic wrap from the pan(s).</li>
            <li>Bake the monkey bread for 30-35 minutes, turning halfway through, until the dough is cooked through (200-205 °F) and golden brown on top.</li>
            <li>Allow the bread to cool for 10 minutes, then flip it onto a serving platter of your choice. Serve warm with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and jam.</li>
        </ol>
