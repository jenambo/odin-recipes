        <!-- Steps for the recipe -->
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by whisking together 850 grams of bread flour and 12 grams of instant yeast in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Once the dry ingredients are evenly dispersed, add 550 grams of water to the bowl and combine. Next, add 17 grams of kosher salt before kneading the dough using your method of choice.</li>
            <li>Place the dough into an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. For what is known as primary bulk fermentation, let the dough rest at room temperature for 2 hours. Or, for what is known as a cold ferment, let the dough rest inside of the refrigerator for 3-5 days. </li>
            <li>Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces by weight to ensure accuracy. Shape each piece into balls by rolling the dough between your hands and pinching the edges down underneath the dough itself until each piece is as round and taut as possible.</li>
            <li>Place the balls of dough on a lightly floured rimmed baking sheet or inside of a proofing container. </li>
            <li>Cover and proof for 1 hour if you made the dough the same day or 1 ½ - 2 hours if the dough is refrigerator cold. The dough should spread out, but not quite double in size</li>
            <li>Flour both your work surface and the dough itself and pat the dough out as wide as possible with your fingers. Leave a very small rim around the outside that will eventually become the crust. </li>
            <li>Begin gently and slowly stretching the dough by passing it knuckle over knuckle until it is as thin as you can get it, which in this case, is about 12 inches wide. Place the stretched out dough on a generously floured pizza peel.</li>
            <li>Roughly purée 1 can of whole San Marzano tomatoes and add a generous pinch of kosher salt. Separately shred or tear pieces of fresh mozzarella. </li>
            <li>Apply the pureed tomatoes and mozzarella cheese very sparingly on top of the pizza dough. </li>
            <li>Place the pizza in the oven at  932°F for only about one minute. Once it emerges from the oven, top it off with some fresh basil. Slice and serve as desired. </li>
        </ol>
